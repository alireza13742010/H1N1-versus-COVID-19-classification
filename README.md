# H1N1-versus-COVID-19-classification
This repository is an implementation over the OPI model to discriminate between COVID-19 and H1N1 subjects.
# Introduction 
 COVID-19 and swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) are both pandemics that sparked significant concern world
wide. Since these two diseases have common symptoms, a fast COVID-19 versus H1N1 screening helps better
 manage patients at healthcare facilities. We present a novel deep model, called Optimized Parallel Inception,
 for fast screening of COVID-19 and H1N1 patients. We also present a Semi-supervised Generative Adversarial
 Network (SGAN) to address the problem related to the smaller size of the COVID-19 and H1N1 research data.
 To evaluate the proposed models, we have merged two separate COVID-19 and H1N1 data from different
 sources to build a new dataset. The created dataset includes 4,383 positive COVID-19 cases, 989 positive
 H1N1 cases, and 1,059 negative cases. We applied SGAN on this dataset to remove issues related to unequal
 class densities. The experimental results show that the proposed modelâ€™s screening accuracy is 99.2% and
 99.6% for COVID-19 and H1N1, respectively. According to our analysis, the most significant symptoms and
 underlying chronic diseases for COVID-19 versus H1N1 screening are dry cough, breathing problems, diabetes,
 and gastrointestinal
